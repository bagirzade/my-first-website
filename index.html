<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.In 2020, the average cost of a data breach was USD 3.86 million globally, and USD 8.64 million in the United States. These costs include the expenses of discovering and responding to the breach, the cost of downtime and lost revenue, and the long-term reputational damage to a business and its brand. Cybercriminals target customers’ personally identifiable information (PII) — names, addresses, national identification numbers (e.g., Social Security number in the US, fiscal codes in Italy), and credit card information — and then sell these records in underground digital marketplaces. Compromised PII often leads to a loss of customer trust, the imposition of regulatory fines, and even legal action.</p>
<p>Security system complexity, created by disparate technologies and a lack of in-house expertise, can amplify these costs. But organizations with a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, governed by best practices and automated using advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, can fight cyberthreats more effectively and reduce the lifecycle and impact of breaches when they occur.</p>
<p>Hackers’ motivation is very varied – it can be anything from idealists to industrial espionage and organized crime. Thus, the term hacker does not mean a criminal or irresponsible person. Some have good intentions and tell companies if they come through systems, while others hack for their own financial gain. By understanding the different types of hackers you find out, you can also understand what protection you need to lock them out.</p>

<p>The hacktivists have somewhat stronger and more defined motives for their actions – this is the online version of an activist. A hacktivist is a hacker or a group of anonymous hackers who think they can bring about social change. These often hack the government and organizations to gain attention or dissatisfaction with their thinking. The purpose of their attacks is often to gain publicity as a result of the attack.</p>

<p><i>State sponsored hackers:</i> 
    These are employed by their state or nation authorities to ‘sniff’ around and penetrate security to obtain confidential information from other governments to stay on top online. These have infinitely large budgets and extremely advanced tools available.</p>

<p><i>A white hat hacker -- or ethical hacker -- is an individual who uses hacking skills to identify security vulnerabilities in hardware, software or networks. However, unlike black hat hackers -- or malicious hackers -- white hat hackers respect the rule of law as it applies to hacking.</i></p>

<h3>A white hat hacker -- or ethical hacker -- is an individual who uses hacking skills to identify security vulnerabilities in hardware, software or networks. However, unlike black hat hackers -- or malicious hackers -- white hat hackers respect the rule of law as it applies to hacking. Many white hat hackers are former black hat hackers. The terms come from old Western movies, where heroes often wore white hats and the bad guys wore black hats.</h3>

 <h3>Gray hat hackers fall somewhere between ethical hackers and threat actors. While their motives may be similar to those two groups, gray hats are more likely than ethical hackers to access systems without authorization; at the same time, they are more likely than threat actors to avoid doing unnecessary damage to the systems they hack. Although they aren't typically -- or only -- motivated by money, gray hat hackers may offer to fix vulnerabilities they have discovered through their own unauthorized activities rather than using their knowledge to exploit vulnerabilities for illegal profit.</h3>

<p>  <strong> Red hat hackers</strong>, <h4>also called eagle-eyed or vigilante hackers, are similar to ethical hackers. Red hat hackers intend to stop unethical attacks by threat actors. While red hat hackers may have a similar intent to ethical hackers, they differ in methodology, as red hat hackers may use illegal or extreme courses of action. Often, red hat hackers will deploy cyber attacks toward the systems of threat actors.A hacker who acts as a digital activist or a vigilante and uses their hacking knowledge to convey a message. Their reasons for hacking might be political, social, religious, or ideological.</h4> </p>

<h1>The Famous Hackers:Albert Gonzalez</h1>
<h3>Albert Gonzalez (born 1981) is an American computer hacker and computer criminal who is accused of masterminding the combined credit card theft and subsequent reselling of more than 170 million card and ATM numbers from 2005 through 2007—the biggest such fraud in history. Gonzalez and his accomplices used SQL injection to deploy backdoors on several corporate systems in order to launch packet sniffing (specifically, ARP Spoofing) attacks which allowed him to steal computer data from internal corporate networks.During his spree he was said to have thrown himself a $75,000 birthday party and complained about having to count $340,000 by hand after his currency-counting machine broke. Gonzalez stayed at lavish hotels but his formal homes were modest.While in Kearny he was accused of being the mastermind of a group of hackers called the Shadowcrew group, which trafficked in 1.5 million stolen credit and ATM card numbers. Although considered the mastermind of the scheme (operating on the site under the screen name of "CumbaJohnny"), he was not indicted. According to the indictment there were 4,000 people who registered with the Shadowcrew.com website. Once registered they could buy stolen account numbers or counterfeit documents at auction or read “Tutorials and How-To’s” describing the use of cryptography in magnetic strips on credit cards, debit cards and ATM cards so that the numbers could be used. Moderators of the website punished members who did not abide by the site's rules, including providing refunds to buyers if the stolen card numbers proved invalid.
